# Alpine.js Pro DevTools
## 📦 About this repo

This repository exists **only** to publish release notes and updates related to the commercial Alpine.js Devtools.  
There is no source code here.

## ❌ Not open source (and here's why)

This is a commercial project.

If you’ve seen how the original Alpine.js Devtools ended up — unmaintained, half-baked, and eventually abandoned — you’ll understand why sustainability matters. Without consistent maintenance (which takes time and resources), tools like this fall apart.

I’m building and maintaining this solo, and unlike the original maintainers, I actually use Alpine.js daily — and not just for simple stuff. I need a devtools that *works*, grows, and actually helps in real projects.

## 💸 About the "commercial" part

I'm still figuring out what the balance looks like — I don’t want to lock everything behind a paywall, but I also need to make sure the project is sustainable. The goal is to provide real value to the community **and** make sure it’s worth the time and energy it takes to build and maintain.

There will be something free, and something paid — the details are still being worked out, and I'll share more as things develop.

## 🛠️ Built because I actually need it

This isn’t a side project or a half-day experiment. I’m dogfooding this tool every day, which means I have a real stake in making sure it’s solid, useful, and maintained long-term.
