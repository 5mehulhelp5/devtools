# Alpine.js Pro DevTools

This repository exists **only** to publish release notes and updates related to the Alpine.js Pro DevTools.

## What is the status?

- The first version of the extension is ready and waiting for approval in the Chrome Web Store.
- It's based on the old DevTools, but on a different tech stack, so the extension is fully Manifest V3 ready.
- Already fixed some bugs and performance issues.
- Will be **100% free** during the first release period, but not forever, more on that below.

To get notified about the release, just watch this repo:

## Why not open source?

- This is a commercial project.
- The old Alpine.js DevTools was left unmaintained for years, and never really was great in the first place (sorry!).
- That happened because there was no reason to keep it alive (aka. money).
- Unlike the existing maintainers, I'm using Alpine.js every day in real work, with non-trivial apps.
- I need a tool that actually works and gets updates when needed, so I'll be dogfooding this extension a lot.

## Why commercial?

- I’m not a big fan of chasing sponsorship deals.
- They’re often short-lived, need a lot of back-and-forth, and honestly feel like a weird mix of begging and business.
- Alpine.js isn’t a huge community, so relying on sponsors might not be enough to keep things going anyway.

Instead:

- If you’re using this tool at work or to make money, you’ll need a license. That’s it.
- I’m **not** planning to charge hobbyists, students, or anyone who just can’t afford it.
- Prices will be adjusted depending on where you live (using [Purchasing Power Parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity)), so it’s fair no matter where you're from.
- For me, it’s just way simpler to offer a product people can buy when they need it.
- Going to a site, entering billing info, and getting what you paid for — that’s quick, clear, and saves time for both sides.
- No messy sponsorship conversations, no awkward “what do I get for this donation” stuff.
- This way, I can offer a solid free version for those who need it, while still making enough to keep fixing bugs, adding features, and supporting the tool long term.
