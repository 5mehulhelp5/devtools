# Alpine.js Pro DevTools

[Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/alpine-pro/projects/3/views/1)

## What is the status?

Extension is ready to use, you can install it right now, for free, from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lljjpbaakboipfnhngbmmfmlbiiklmnl).

It's a first usable version, but already a major improvement over the old DevTools.
- It's not constantly crashing
- Can handle lots of data and do it fast
- Refreshed UI
- Dark mode
- You don't have to constantly keep re-opening the DevTools to see current state of the app
- List of the components represent what you see in the code, not some random IDs or labels
- Attributes are grouped by type and sorted, so it's super easy to find and edit
- You can easily jump to the elements tab or scroll component into a view with a single button

Watch the launch video to see it in action:

## Why not open source?

- This is a commercial project.
- The old Alpine.js DevTools was left unmaintained for years, and never really was great in the first place (sorry!).
- That happened because there was no reason to keep it alive (aka. money).
- Unlike the existing maintainers, I'm using Alpine.js every day in real work, with non-trivial apps.
- I need a tool that actually works and gets updates when needed, so I'll be dogfooding this extension a lot.

## Why commercial?

- I’m not a big fan of chasing sponsorship deals, especially when they are productized, like subscription to get early access / premium features.
- They’re often short-lived, need a lot of back-and-forth, and honestly feel like a weird mix of begging and business.
- Alpine.js isn’t a huge community, so relying on sponsors might not be enough to keep things going anyway.

Instead:

- If you’re using this tool at work or to make money, you’ll need a license. That’s it.
- I’m **not** planning to charge hobbyists, students, or anyone who just can’t afford it.
- Prices will be adjusted depending on where you live (using [Purchasing Power Parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity)), so it’s fair no matter where you're from.
- For me, it’s just way simpler to offer a product people can buy when they need it.
- Going to a site, entering billing info, and getting what you paid for — that’s quick, clear, and saves time for both sides.
- No messy sponsorship conversations, no awkward “what do I get for this donation” stuff.

This way, I can offer a **solid free version** for those who need it, while still making enough to keep fixing bugs, adding features, and supporting the tool long term.
