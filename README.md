## 📦 About this repo

This repository exists **only** to publish release notes and updates related to the commercial Alpine.js Devtools.  
There is no source code here.

## ❌ Not open source (and here's why)

This is a commercial project.

If you’ve seen how the original Alpine.js Devtools ended up — unmaintained, half-baked, and eventually abandoned — you’ll understand why sustainability matters. Without consistent maintenance (aka. money which can buy time), tools like this fall apart.

I’m building and maintaining this solo, and unlike the original maintainers, I actually use Alpine.js daily, and not just for simple stuff. I need a devtools that *works*, grows, and actually helps in real projects.

## 💸 Why commercial?

I chose the commercial route because, frankly, I think it's the more straightforward and realistic way to keep this project alive.  
For small ecosystems like Alpine.js, vague sponsorship models don’t really cut it — there just isn’t a massive audience to pull from. Chasing donations and hoping for recurring sponsors takes more time and energy than it gives back.

It makes more sense to offer a clear, valuable product that companies can pay for — especially when it helps their dev teams work faster and better.  
Convincing a few teams to get a license is way more practical than trying to rally hundreds of small supporters just to break even.

That said — I'm not trying to lock everything behind a paywall. I do want to offer something for free. The goal is to strike a healthy balance between supporting the community and making this sustainable long-term. More on that soon.
